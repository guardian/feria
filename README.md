# Feria

Uses Selenium to access Janus, retrieve developer credentials for a given AWS account and update the corresponding profile credentials.

## How to install

1. Clone this repo

2. (Optional) Add the bin directory to your `PATH` by running [`install.sh`](./install.sh)

## How to run

Whenever you want to update your profile credentials, run Feria and pass it the name of the profile. e.g.

```
$ feria capi
```

It will take a while the first time you run it, because it has to build itself.

## Usage

```

        The type of access you need. One of [dev, admin, cloudformation]. Default = dev
  --alias <value>

  profile
        The AWS profile ID, e.g. capi
```

## Requirements/restrictions

* Expects `sbt` and `aws` to be on the `PATH`
* Currently only supports Firefox. Expects you to be logged in to Google in Firefox's default profile.
